Recently, I have been using very simple sketches created in Figma to influence my Midjourney prompts, and the results are amazing.
First, you can do this with Photoshop, Illustration, Canva, or other toolseven drawn sketches. However, for this tutorial, we'll be using Figma. If you want to learn more about Midjourney, check out my Beginner's Guide and Complete Guide to Image Effects.
