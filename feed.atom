Even in a vast blockchain network with countless nodes and layers, users need help utilizing the decentralized network's complete potential because DApps use different chains. Some use Ethereum, some Polygon, some Gnosis, and so on!
In this environment, developers should build chain-agnostic applicationsno dependency on one chain and no restriction for any user.
Now, solving this interoperability issue between different chains requires devs to build robust and, more importantly, secure designs, which is a highly technical and resourceful process, and to save devs from going through such pain Hyperlane comes into the picture.
This article will explain almost all about Hyperlane and how it works, so grab a coffee  and LFG 🚀

With the rise of layer-2 solutions and cheap RPCs, this doesn't have to be the case! This tutorial will explain building an NFT Collection using the ERC-721 token standard. You will store all NFT assets and metadata on IPFS with QuickNode and deploy the smart contract on Optimism Goerli Testnet.
Requirements
A basic understanding of Solidity development will be helpful but is not required.
A basic understanding of the ERC-721 token standard will be helpful but is not required.
A basic understanding of the Remix IDE will be helpful but is not required.
Image assets and metadata of the NFT collections.

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were joined by CEO Steffen Kux who gave us an overview of dm3 Protocol
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Steffen Kux is CEO at dm3, the web3 messaging protocol for secure and interoperable communication. He's an applied mathematician with over 20 years of experience in method and software development. Since 2017, he's implemented blockchain technology for real-world applications in IoT, energy, mobility, asset management, and self-sovereign identity.
🔥 About dm3 Protocol
From the dm3 Protocol documentation:
The dm3 (Decentralized Messaging for web3 or Direct Message 3) protocol is an end-2-end encrypted peer-2-peer messaging protocol, rooted in ENS (Ethereum Name Service). It is decentralized, has no single-points-of-failure, has a lean architecture with minimum resource requirements, and enables interoperability with other messaging solutions while preserving the self-sovereignty of its users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I wrote about running an Arweave gateway on GitHub Codespaces for development, but this was just an exercise to get to know AR.IO's gateway node.
Codespaces are short-lived cloud instances that start when we open VSCode in the browser. Nice for development, but not so nice for a real gateway.
Fly.io, or Fly for short, on the other hand, supplies us with short-lived cloud instances that start when someone sends a request to a specific domain - any requests - so it's perfect for a gateway.

It was a fascinating conversation and I learned a lot about seasteading. Seasteading is a concept that involves building permanent human habitation in international waters. The idea […]
