In modern-day software development, APIs and SDKs have become essential parts; because they have so much in common, they often get mixed up.
In my opinion, in the first half of 2022, we had an uptrend in Developer Experience (DX), while User Experience (UX) dominated the second half. APIs and SDKs play an essential part in improving both experiences. A well-known SDK is Google SDK for analytics which developers use to get data about user behaviours.

🚀 About Cypherock
Cypherock is a Consensys-backed startup, building the worlds first hardware wallet without a seedphrase backup.
The current issues with key management pose massive barriers to the adoption of decentralized technologies. Cypherock believes digital assets will have exponentially more value in the future and that will just not be limited to Cryptocurrency. Cypherock's mission is to empower people to be self-sovereign and to have the same peace of mind and control with their crypto and personal data that they have with their savings in the bank vaults.

We will use thirdweb ContractKit for the ERC-721 token standard, thirdweb deploy to deploy our smart contract to Mumbai Testnet, and Chainlink Data Feeds to fetch the realtime price of Matic to set the base price for minting NFT. We will build and deploy a smart contract that allows users to mint NFT. The user has to pay at least $1 in Matic to mint the NFT. We get the actual price conversion using Chainlink Data Feeds.
What is ERC-721?
ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.

🧠 About Storedat
Storedat is a GraphQL API built on top of existing web3 storage providers like Arweave and Filecoin. We exist to accelerate the adoption of decentralized storage by providing a provider agnostic way to read and write data with those protocols all the while abstracting away web3 from the user. No dealing with wallets, signing transactions, storing private keys, paying transaction costs, and so on.
Just plug in and Storedat

In this weeks episode of DevNTell, DAO member Gery Pollak presents an overview of Blocktorch: observability for the decentralized stack
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Gery has 6 years experience working in business development at FAANG and investing in startups in central & eastern Europe as a VC. He is a self taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer. 
🔥 About Blocktorch
Blocktorch's mission is to build an end-to-end web3 observability platform to support engineers building dApps, similar to what DataDog achieved for the cloud but with a focus on decentralized backend architecture
