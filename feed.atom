        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a token-gated community for live concerts using QuickNode. We will create a custom token on the Ethereum network, develop a smart contract for the community, and design a frontend interface using QuickNode's API. This platform will allow concert organizers to offer exclusive live concert access to token holders.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts
Familiarity with JavaScript and web development
Node.js and npm installed on your local machine
MetaMask or another Ethereum-compatible wallet

Step 1: Setting up the project
As our first step, we will create a smart contract in Solidity for the token we later use for the gating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, you will learn how to migrate your DApp from Goerli to Sepolia using QuickNode, a fast and reliable RPC node provider. 
As you may know, the Goerli network has faced several issues recently, from the low availability of test funds to network downtime. Considering this, it makes perfect sense to take your testing from Goerli to Sepolia.
1. Updating the RPC node
The first step for migrating your DApp is to get the RPC node of the new test network. For our example, we will use the Sepolia test network and QuickNode as the node provider.
Go to their RPC Endpoints Service section by clicking on this link and click on the "Create an endpoint" button.

Select the chain. In our case, we will be selecting Ethereum.

Select the network, and click "continue".

We then used the change-data capture design pattern to replay all transfer events of a given smart contract.
By capturing those events through the log entries they create, we could aggregate them and determine how many Murakami Flower NFTs a given wallet address has, or which holder wallets constitute a whale, etc.
In Part II, I want to dive deeper into the interaction between blocks, transactions, and the log entries they create, as well as the process of log ABI translation which is critical for any chain-based analytics.

Indeed, in the current scenario, few NFT marketplaces cater to non-web3 users, primarily due to the poor User Experience (UX) they have to face.
A significant barrier to entry for these users is the complexity of the Web3 ecosystem, including the need to understand concepts such as wallets, private keys, and gas fees. Moreover, the onboarding process can be tedious and confusing, with users having to set up and manage wallets and acquire cryptocurrency to interact with the marketplace. To address these issues and make NFT marketplaces more accessible to non-web3 users, it's essential to focus on improving UX.
In this guide, youll learn how to create a marketplace on Polygon and make it easy for non-crypto natives to use the marketplace by allowing them to log in with their emai…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamr is a decentralized, real-time data network that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network where each node connects with other nodes without a central server. Streamr uses a publish-subscribe system where one peer writes data to the network, and others read the data. This continuous flow of data allows for efficient and effective real-time data transport and communication.

This tutorial will walk you through the Streamr network and how to get started. We will create a simple Next.js application that will consume data from a public stream and create and write to one. We will plot and visualize this data using a line chart and become acquainted with the Streamr network.
