        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating truly random numbers on a computer is a complex mathematical problem. However, most programming languages today have either native support for generating random numbers or come with supporting libraries that generate random numbers with an acceptable level of determinism mixed in.
While generating acceptably-random numbers is a mostly solved problem in traditional computing, it is nigh impossible to do so on blockchains.

Yes, you could hash together a bunch of block and transaction data with a keccak256 function, but that is ad-hoc at best and is definitely not production-worthy code today.
If you've been in Web3 for any reasonable amount of time, you have undoubtedly heard of Chainlink.
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that feeds a variety of data to blockchains in …]]></summary>

In this week's episode of DevNTell, Josh Long gave us an overview of Authentication with Lit Protocol
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Josh is an engineer in the web3 space with a focus on developer tooling. Having worked for web3 and IoT companies, Josh loves creating developer tooling, and helping others understand complex topics in order to achieve their development goals.
🔥 About Lit Protocol
From the Lit Protocol Docs:
Lit Protocol lets you create and manage distributed cryptographic key-pairs for condition-based encryption and programmatic signing. A decentralized key management network, Lit can be used in place of centralized key custodians and other key management solutions.
