When it came to my turn, I did not have a hard time coming up with an answer. It was back during the end of the 90s, and I was running one of the last bulletin board systems (BBSes) in my hometown of San Diego. For those who may not recall, a BBS was a network pre-Web that ran on dial-up servers. There used to be countless BBSes across the globe spanning every interest area and topic, but as the Web grew, the popularity of the BBS declined. 
A small San Diego publication interviewed me as part of a story on the end of the BBS era, and I was asked in that interview if I thought the Web would make the BBS irrelevant. In my defiant teenage voice, I triumphantly declar…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a software or web developer, you will work with different components, some of which you will use more often, like application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) mainly because developers are keen to improve the software development cycles. In modern-day software development, APIs and SDKs have become essential parts; because they have so much in common, they often get mixed up.
In my opinion, in the first half of 2022, we had an uptrend in Developer Experience (DX), while User Experience (UX) dominated the second half. APIs and SDKs play an essential part in improving both experiences. A well-known SDK is Google SDK for analytics which developers use to get data about user behaviours.
