In today's post, let's learn about the chain interoperability (CI) requirements in Web3.
There has been a lot of recent fuss about cross-chain applications and protocols coming up with their chain/frameworks/libraries to help the devs build cross-chain applications and leverage the power of CI. But before anything, we should understand the requirements and advantages of CI. I will discuss a few significant areas in which interoperability will directly impact Web3.
Let's learn the fundamentals first 🙌
What is Chain Interoperability?
CI is the ability of blockchain networks to communicate and share data and resources to form a more extensive unified network.
Imagine a chain with good security and one with widespread decentralization coming together and sharing their properties. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smart contract development is vital to building decentralized applications on the blockchain. However, as with any software development, debugging smart contracts can be challenging but can quickly determine the cause of a single transaction or contract execution failure with an advanced tool for debugging Solidity smart contracts.
We can implement a suitable solution once we identify the error that led to a specific issue and learn in-depth details about the error's nature.
This guide will provide tips and tools for debugging smart contracts to help Web3 developers ensure their contracts work as intended.
