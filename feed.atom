        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week's episode of DevNTell we were joined by Gilad who gave us an overview of 0xCord. In this presentation, Gilad demos how to use 0xCord with Chainlink VRF V2 both on-chain and off-chain.
ðŸŒŸ Developer Spotlight
Gilad studied computer science at Columbia and has been writing solidity code for the past 5 years. Hes currently working on 0xCord, a web3 infra hub for developers.
ðŸ”¥ About 0xCord
0xCord.com is a web3 infra hub for developers. It's the easiest way to access web3 infrastructure via native payments, composability, and configuration, all in one unified place. With 0xCord's off-chain API, you can easily consume the Chainlink VRF V2 through a simple RESTful JSON API call, bridging the gap between web2 and decentralized web3 infrastructure. [Source]

Indeed, in the current scenario, few NFT marketplaces cater to non-web3 users, primarily due to the poor User Experience (UX) they have to face.
A significant barrier to entry for these users is the complexity of the Web3 ecosystem, including the need to understand concepts such as wallets, private keys, and gas fees. Moreover, the onboarding process can be tedious and confusing, with users having to set up and manage wallets and acquire cryptocurrency to interact with the marketplace. To address these issues and make NFT marketplaces more accessible to non-web3 users, it's essential to focus on improving UX.

This continuous flow of data allows for efficient and effective real-time data transport and communication.

This tutorial will walk you through the Streamr network and how to get started. We will create a simple Next.js application that will consume data from a public stream and create and write to one.
