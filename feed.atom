        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamr is a decentralized, real-time data network that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network where each node connects with other nodes without a central server. Streamr uses a publish-subscribe system where one peer writes data to the network, and others read the data. This continuous flow of data allows for efficient and effective real-time data transport and communication.

This tutorial will walk you through the Streamr network and how to get started. We will create a simple Next.js application that will consume data from a public stream and create and write to one. We will plot and visualize this data using a line chart and become acquainted with the Streamr network.
The Functionalities
Streamr's network consists of both off-chain and on-chain segments. The network serves …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Achieving scalability for your DApp involves a delicate balance between security, decentralization, and performance, which requires careful trade-offs. To begin the process, you must decide which blockchain to build on and how to connect your smart contract to the frontend application. QuickNode provides support for various chains and offers a rapid connection between your DApp and the blockchain.
This blog post explores ways to enhance your DApps using QuickNode services. We'll demonstrate how to create a straightforward ERC20 token information tracker that displays essential token details. Then, we'll utilize QuickNode services to scale up the tracker for maximum efficiency.
