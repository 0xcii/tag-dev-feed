With the rise of NFTs, developers are looking for efficient and flexible ways to build applications that leverage the unique properties of NFTs.
But getting all the marketplace data in a consistent manner isn't a simple task; developers have to crawl through the blockchain and filter out the important bits and pieces of data. A tedious and frustrating undertaking.
QuickNode's GraphQL NFT API provides a simple and unified method for developers to interact with NFT marketplaces, regardless of the underlying technology. This tutorial will explain step-by-step how to use this API.

I'm one of the core developers working on InterplanetaryFonts, a Web3 NFT marketplace and collaboration platform for creators and collectors of Fonts (@IPFonts/@ipfonts). Below I will describe a tricky problem we ran into when developing our subgraph on The Graph that relates to retrieving data hosted on IPFS that will hopefully help you in your Web3 journey.
Problem
Our subgraph at InterplanetaryFonts that powers our DApp on https://interplanetaryfonts.xyz/ was missing smart contract entity metadata, which is data that does not live directly in the smart contract but on IPFS as a JSON file. 
This can be a frustrating and confusing problem, but with the right approach and tools, you can resolve it quickly.

        <updated>2023-01-28T02:32:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week's episode of DevNTell, CTO of Mirror World Jonathan Bakebwa gave us an overview of the Mirror World SDK: a cross-platform SDK that provides a simple, declarative API interface for building Mobile and Web dApps in a multi-chain context.
🚀 About Mirror World
From the Mirror World Docs:
We built Mirror World to accelerate the adoption of decentralized technologies. At present there are a lot of challenges faced with building decentralized applications:
For users, the onboarding process is severely complex - requiring new user to install various wallet extensions and learn about private key management before they even interact with the dApp is a taxing effort.
For developers, it is no hidden secret that building Web 3 applications is also significantly complex. The average developer will not only have to have proficiency both at the protocol level for blockchain development, they must also possess application level proficiency to build a successful dApps to their users. This increases the time to market.
For individuals/teams with limited time and resources, this effort would be better spent improving their core product and iterating quickly for their users.
Therefore, we built the Mirror World Smart SDK to make it easy for developers to:
Onboard new Web3 users with one click. - No more seed-phrases! Mirror World's Smart Auth provides authentication with methods your users are already familiar with.
Fast-track your Web3 development time. - The Mirror World API provides a simple, yet powerful and declarative interface for interacting with the chain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you know TypeScript, adding the ability to create, mint, and manage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to your app is easy. The Infura NFT SDK wraps REST calls to Ethereum nodes, abstracting away the technical compilations and making it possible to work with NFTs with just an Infura account, some configuration, and a few lines of code. The Infura NFT SDK also doesn't require the overhead of learning Solidity, importing ABIs, etc. Whether new to Web3 or highly experienced, Infura NFT SDK makes NFTs easy.
Let's jump in, build, and deploy an ERC721 NFT to see how it works.
What is the Infura NFT SDK?
The Infura NFT SDK is an SDK that allows you to build and interact with NFTs easily. It's implemented in TypeScript, a programming language that is a strict superset of JavaScript. The SDK includes cr…]]></summary>

Recently, I posted on my LinkedIn page about the importance of blockchain education and received a lot of questions from people asking me to explain what blockchain technology is. This shows that many people are still unfamiliar with blockchains or have not heard of them, despite their digital literacy. As much as we may want to blame them for not paying enough attention online, it is not fair to blame these people.  Instead, we should blame those in the industry who have made it appear as though only highly technical people can understand and participate in the space. This is not the case, and it's important to educate more people about the reality of blockchains.
Blockchains are for everyone, but understanding how to use them in everyday life is necessary to grasp this revolutiona…]]></summary>

What is the Filecoin Virtual Machine?
Let's start by understanding the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). As a Web3 developer, you may already know that Filecoin is a decentralized storage provider or a peer-to-peer network that stores files with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time, to be exact. Now think of adding a computational layer on the top of Filecoin, that FVM for you.
The FVM unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from programmable storage primitives (such as storage bounties, auctions, and more), to cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g. trustlessly connecting Filecoin with Ethereum, Solana, NEAR, and more), t…]]></summary>
