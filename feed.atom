🧠 About Storedat
Storedat is a GraphQL API built on top of existing web3 storage providers like Arweave and Filecoin. We exist to accelerate the adoption of decentralized storage by providing a provider agnostic way to read and write data with those protocols all the while abstracting away web3 from the user. No dealing with wallets, signing transactions, storing private keys, paying transaction costs, and so on.
Just plug in and Storedat

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This DevRel post arose from my research on Arweave for the Eden Protocol. Eden Protocol is a Developer DAO project centered on talent management. We're developing artificial intelligence to match the right people to the right opportunities at the right time. 
BluePanda, CTO of Eden, asked me to research Arweave for permanently storing endorsement data on a blockchain. This data will be generated as a person is endorsed based on their performance on a project, so long-term storage and immutability are essential. Arweave was a natural fit because it met all the requirements for implementing this feature in Eden. The astonishing thing was how simple it was to put this into action. Thanks to Arweave's clear documentation. In this post, I will share the information I gleaned from that research.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, fren! gm. 
Recently, I worked on an NFT project that required IPFS for storing the NFT images and metadata. That sparked my interest in learning more about decentralized storage, which has fascinated me for a while now.
So, today we're gonna learn about decentralized storage (let's call it DStorage for short) and some of the most popular DStorage protocols in this blog post.
Let's dive in!
What is DStorage?
As its name implies, DStorage is a storage system that does not rely on a central server or authority.
Unlike a centralized storage system managed and operated by a single centralized entity, a peer-to-peer network of user-operated nodes operates DStorage, each of which stores a copy of the data creating a resilient file storage-sharing system.
The decentralization makes it much mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It consists of three components:
Forge: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat, and DappTools).
Cast: CLI for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.
Anvil: local Ethereum node, similar to Ganache or Hardhat Network.
Why Should We Use Foundry?

Its speedy; no more wasted time while running tests.
It allows you to write tests in Solidity, which minimizes context switching.
Many testing features like fuzzing, console.log, and cheat codes give you more power and flexibility.

How to install dependencies in Foundry (i.e., OpenZeppelin)

In this weeks episode of DevNTell, Kai Huang and Gov go over their project, Supercluster Labs
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kai has been in Product Management for the last 6 years, currently working as a PM for MetaMask.  Kai Started working on Supercluster about 4 months ago with the team he formed at HackFS '22 with the goal to provide a super easy decentralized file sharing application.
Gov is a blockchain/web3 developer and researcher who has been in the space since 2014. He has worked on several projects in the space, notably at a venture funded project that developed secure p2p file sharing for governments. In addition, he has participated in several hackathons, notably creating a top 10 hack at HackFS 2020 and winning 2nd place for the IPFS prize at HackFS 2022.
🚀 About Supercluster Labs
Supercluster is a decentralized file sharing solution purpose built for DAOs.  Supercluster Files enables DAOs to share content between team members without having to rely on centralized parties.

"SSX is a library that enables you to easily add user authentication, session management, and more to your dapp."
https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/blob/main/README.md

Okay, But What Is It?
It's an app that allows you to administer authentication sessions for native Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE pronounced see-we) and have a way to see stats on those sessions.

Why Is This Needed?
Abstracting Functionality
Could you build out your own user session manager with SIWE? Yes, you could, but like everything, why would you keep building the same tool systems repeatedly? Just like when services like Auth0 came into the market, we abstracted the need to try to build and manage authentication services.
Easy Implementation
It's also faster to get up and running with sessions without having …]]></summary>
