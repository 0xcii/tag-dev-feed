Indeed, in the current scenario, few NFT marketplaces cater to non-web3 users, primarily due to the poor User Experience (UX) they have to face.
A significant barrier to entry for these users is the complexity of the Web3 ecosystem, including the need to understand concepts such as wallets, private keys, and gas fees. Moreover, the onboarding process can be tedious and confusing, with users having to set up and manage wallets and acquire cryptocurrency to interact with the marketplace. To address these issues and make NFT marketplaces more accessible to non-web3 users, it's essential to focus on improving UX.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamr is a decentralized, real-time data network that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network where each node connects with other nodes without a central server. Streamr uses a publish-subscribe system where one peer writes data to the network, and others read the data. This continuous flow of data allows for efficient and effective real-time data transport and communication.

This tutorial will walk you through the Streamr network and how to get started. We will create a simple Next.js application that will consume data from a public stream and create and write to one. We will plot and visualize this data using a line chart and become acquainted with the Streamr network.
The Functionalities
Streamr's network consists of both off-chain and on-chain segments. The network serves …]]></summary>
