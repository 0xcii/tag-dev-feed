        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the need for secure smart contracts. With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.
On top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately. This is where security tools come into play.

In this week's episode of DevNTell, Nasir Jamal (nas) gave us a look at his project, Hashleap: a web3 payments and financial management platform
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Nasir is a software engineer with more than a decade and a half of experience in startups where he held IC and leadership positions. Before HashLeap he cofounded another startup called Rodeo to provide analytics to gig workers for which we raised close to a million dollars led by Seedcamp. He architected and built the first MVP along with the initial engineering team he hired. The company is still going on and his cofounders have gone on to raise another round. Before Rodeo, he was Director of Engineering at Wise and was also one of the first engineers at Deliveroo and helped grow the product team from under 10 to ~400. Throughout his career, he has been involved with early-stage companies with a focus on iterating and delivering products that solve customer problems.
🔥 About Hashleap
From the About section of the Hashleap blog:
Hashleap is on a mission to simplify crypto payments for small businesses, web3 companies or freelancers, DAOs and charities by making it part of their business process rather than a disconnected activity.

Midjourney is just one of many AI image generators that have sprung up recently. But unlike its competitors, Midjourney has a more dream-like and artsy style. It's not just about churning out photos - it's more like a painting tool that can help you create something truly unique. If you're into science-fiction or gothic artwork, then Midjourney is perfect.
Additive Prompting
One of the best ways to use Midjourney is with a technique known as additive prompting. Its a simple way of writing a structured prompt, and it involves creating specific sect…]]></summary>

What is QuickNode?
QuickNode is a blockchain platform that provides infrastructure for developers to build and scale decentralized applications (DApps). It offers a suite of tools and services, including a developer API, to make it easier for developers to build, test, and deploy DApps on multiple blockchain networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🌈 GM
In this week's episode of DevNTell, DAO member Gery Pollak gives us an updated look at Blocktorch: an observability platform that helps builders understand the behavior of a decentralized application holistically.
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Gery has 6 years of experience working in business development at FAANG and investing in startups in central & eastern Europe as a VC. He is a self-taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer.
🔥 About Blocktorch
From the About page of Blocktorch:
The number of decentralized applications, their developers as well as users are growing at rapid speed, yet the tooling around web3 is not evolving fast enough. The underlying decentralized architecture is getting more complex and less understandable. To ensure web3 is mass market ready reliability is key.  The talented engineering teams pushing the frontiers of innovation need the best tools to build the best products.  
We at Blocktorch are re-imagining how developers build and maintain their decentralized applications. We believe in empowering every software engineering team to gain a deeper understanding of their smart contracts as well as other decentralized components such that they can troubleshoot and resolve anomalies in minutes, not hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a token-gated community for live concerts using QuickNode. We will create a custom token on the Ethereum network, develop a smart contract for the community, and design a frontend interface using QuickNode's API. This platform will allow concert organizers to offer exclusive live concert access to token holders.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts
Familiarity with JavaScript and web development
Node.js and npm installed on your local machine
MetaMask or another Ethereum-compatible wallet

Step 1: Setting up the project
As our first step, we will create a smart contract in Solidity for the token we later use for the gating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, you will learn how to migrate your DApp from Goerli to Sepolia using QuickNode, a fast and reliable RPC node provider. 
As you may know, the Goerli network has faced several issues recently, from the low availability of test funds to network downtime. Considering this, it makes perfect sense to take your testing from Goerli to Sepolia.
1. Updating the RPC node
The first step for migrating your DApp is to get the RPC node of the new test network. For our example, we will use the Sepolia test network and QuickNode as the node provider.
Go to their RPC Endpoints Service section by clicking on this link and click on the "Create an endpoint" button.

Select the chain. In our case, we will be selecting Ethereum.

Select the network, and click "continue".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Part I of Decoding Decentralization, we framed Ethereum (and all blockchains really) as a distributed decentralized database.
We then used the change-data capture design pattern to replay all transfer events of a given smart contract.
By capturing those events through the log entries they create, we could aggregate them and determine how many Murakami Flower NFTs a given wallet address has, or which holder wallets constitute a whale, etc.
In Part II, I want to dive deeper into the interaction between blocks, transactions, and the log entries they create, as well as the process of log ABI translation which is critical for any chain-based analytics.

Camera angles are a crucial tool in filmmaking, photography, and synthography, that can make or break a scene, setting the tone and creating the desired mood for the audience.

In this blog post, well cover the best practices of prompting four standard camera angles in Midjourney:
The eye-level angle
The low angle
The high angle
