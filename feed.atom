In today's post, let's learn about the chain interoperability (CI) requirements in Web3.
There has been a lot of recent fuss about cross-chain applications and protocols coming up with their chain/frameworks/libraries to help the devs build cross-chain applications and leverage the power of CI. But before anything, we should understand the requirements and advantages of CI. I will discuss a few significant areas in which interoperability will directly impact Web3.
Let's learn the fundamentals first 🙌
What is Chain Interoperability?
CI is the ability of blockchain networks to communicate and share data and resources to form a more extensive unified network.
Imagine a chain with good security and one with widespread decentralization coming together and sharing their properties. …]]></summary>

However, as with any software development, debugging smart contracts can be challenging but can quickly determine the cause of a single transaction or contract execution failure with an advanced tool for debugging Solidity smart contracts.
We can implement a suitable solution once we identify the error that led to a specific issue and learn in-depth details about the error's nature.
This guide will provide tips and tools for debugging smart contracts to help Web3 developers ensure their contracts work as intended.

Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with the term "DApp" - we'll start with the basics and explain everything along the way.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete beginner, we guarantee you'll be a pro in no time!
So, let's get started.
What is a DApp?
If you're unfamiliar with the term "DApp," it stands for Decentralized Application, a software application operating on a decentralized network like Ethereum.
One of the primary benefits of DApps is their additional security layer, as transactions are encrypted and distributed across the blockchain networ…]]></summary>

In this weeks episode of DevNTell, co-founders Kai Huang and Gov go over the latest on their project, Supercluster Labs
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kai has been in Product Management for the last 6 years, currently working as a PM for MetaMask. Kai Started working on Supercluster about 4 months ago with the team he formed at HackFS '22 with the goal to provide a super easy decentralized file-sharing application.
Gov is a blockchain/web3 developer and researcher who has been in the space since 2014. He has worked on several projects in the space, notably at a venture-funded project that developed secure p2p file sharing for governments. In addition, he has participated in several hackathons, notably creating a top 10 hack at HackFS 2020 and winning 2nd place for the IPFS prize at HackFS 2022.
🔥 About Supercluster Labs
Supercluster is a decentralized file-sharing solution purpose-built for DAOs. Supercluster Files enables DAOs to share content between team members without having to rely on centralized parties.

The Graph: Indexes for Querying Blockchain Networks and IPFS
Yaniv had a vision in 2017 when he co-founded The Graph to be an indexing service for the blockchain and the worlds knowledge, which needs a complex set of infrastructures to index data in a decentralized way, with different roles such as indexers, delegators, and curators.
When we consider the types of data currently on The Graph, we realize we are dealing with a relatively small dataset. The crypto world focuses on DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and, more…]]></summary>

Understanding the Fundamentals
Before we start, let's look at the basics, so we're all on the same page.
What is Chain-Interoperability?
Chain interoperability is the capability of different blockchain networks or systems to interact and exchange information and resources. In simpler terms, blockchain systems can work together as a unified network instead of operating in isolation.
For example, we could use one blo…]]></summary>
