        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🌈 GM
In this week's episode of DevNTell, DAO member Gery Pollak gives us an updated look at Blocktorch: an observability platform that helps builders understand the behavior of a decentralized application holistically.
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Gery has 6 years of experience working in business development at FAANG and investing in startups in central & eastern Europe as a VC. He is a self-taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer.
🔥 About Blocktorch
From the About page of Blocktorch:
The number of decentralized applications, their developers as well as users are growing at rapid speed, yet the tooling around web3 is not evolving fast enough. The underlying decentralized architecture is getting more complex and less understandable. To ensure web3 is mass market ready reliability is key.  The talented engineering teams pushing the frontiers of innovation need the best tools to build the best products.  
We at Blocktorch are re-imagining how developers build and maintain their decentralized applications. We believe in empowering every software engineering team to gain a deeper understanding of their smart contracts as well as other decentralized components such that they can troubleshoot and resolve anomalies in minutes, not hours.

We will create a custom token on the Ethereum network, develop a smart contract for the community, and design a frontend interface using QuickNode's API. This platform will allow concert organizers to offer exclusive live concert access to token holders.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts
Familiarity with JavaScript and web development
Node.js and npm installed on your local machine
MetaMask or another Ethereum-compatible wallet

Step 1: Setting up the project
As our first step, we will create a smart contract in Solidity for the token we later use for the gating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, you will learn how to migrate your DApp from Goerli to Sepolia using QuickNode, a fast and reliable RPC node provider. 
As you may know, the Goerli network has faced several issues recently, from the low availability of test funds to network downtime. Considering this, it makes perfect sense to take your testing from Goerli to Sepolia.
1. Updating the RPC node
The first step for migrating your DApp is to get the RPC node of the new test network. For our example, we will use the Sepolia test network and QuickNode as the node provider.
Go to their RPC Endpoints Service section by clicking on this link and click on the "Create an endpoint" button.

Select the chain. In our case, we will be selecting Ethereum.

Select the network, and click "continue".

We then used the change-data capture design pattern to replay all transfer events of a given smart contract.
By capturing those events through the log entries they create, we could aggregate them and determine how many Murakami Flower NFTs a given wallet address has, or which holder wallets constitute a whale, etc.
In Part II, I want to dive deeper into the interaction between blocks, transactions, and the log entries they create, as well as the process of log ABI translation which is critical for any chain-based analytics.
