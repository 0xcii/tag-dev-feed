In today's post, let's learn about the chain interoperability (CI) requirements in Web3.
There has been a lot of recent fuss about cross-chain applications and protocols coming up with their chain/frameworks/libraries to help the devs build cross-chain applications and leverage the power of CI. But before anything, we should understand the requirements and advantages of CI. I will discuss a few significant areas in which interoperability will directly impact Web3.
Let's learn the fundamentals first 🙌
What is Chain Interoperability?
CI is the ability of blockchain networks to communicate and share data and resources to form a more extensive unified network.
Imagine a chain with good security and one with widespread decentralization coming together and sharing their properties. …]]></summary>

However, as with any software development, debugging smart contracts can be challenging but can quickly determine the cause of a single transaction or contract execution failure with an advanced tool for debugging Solidity smart contracts.
We can implement a suitable solution once we identify the error that led to a specific issue and learn in-depth details about the error's nature.

In this weeks episode of DevNTell, co-founders Kai Huang and Gov go over the latest on their project, Supercluster Labs
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kai has been in Product Management for the last 6 years, currently working as a PM for MetaMask. Kai Started working on Supercluster about 4 months ago with the team he formed at HackFS '22 with the goal to provide a super easy decentralized file-sharing application.
Gov is a blockchain/web3 developer and researcher who has been in the space since 2014. He has worked on several projects in the space, notably at a venture-funded project that developed secure p2p file sharing for governments. In addition, he has participated in several hackathons, notably creating a top 10 hack at HackFS 2020 and winning 2nd place for the IPFS prize at HackFS 2022.
🔥 About Supercluster Labs
Supercluster is a decentralized file-sharing solution purpose-built for DAOs. Supercluster Files enables DAOs to share content between team members without having to rely on centralized parties.

The Graph: Indexes for Querying Blockchain Networks and IPFS
Yaniv had a vision in 2017 when he co-founded The Graph to be an indexing service for the blockchain and the worlds knowledge, which needs a complex set of infrastructures to index data in a decentralized way, with different roles such as indexers, delegators, and curators.
When we consider the types of data currently on The Graph, we realize we are dealing with a relatively small dataset. The crypto world focuses on DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and, more…]]></summary>

Understanding the Fundamentals
Before we start, let's look at the basics, so we're all on the same page.
What is Chain-Interoperability?
Chain interoperability is the capability of different blockchain networks or systems to interact and exchange information and resources. In simpler terms, blockchain systems can work together as a unified network instead of operating in isolation.
For example, we could use one blo…]]></summary>
