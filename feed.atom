        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are already turning the world of blockchain upside down. Whether it's batching thousands of transactions together or providing verifiable computation at massively decreased gas costs, these mathematical marvels are shaping up to be a boost that will propel blockchain technology into its next era.
Naturally, developers are very excited about the prospect of learning to use new tools powered by ZKPs and building their own zero knowledge applications or zkApps.
Mina is a Layer 1 blockchain built from the ground up using ZKPs. Developers can use the cutting-edge cryptography which powers Mina to build zkApps with SnarkyJS, a TypeScript library.
In this blog, you will build your first zkApp, with SnarkyJS. You will learn the basics of how ZKPs work, how to set up yo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cross-chain communication is one of the hottest topics in Web3 today. There are many blockchains in Web3, meaning divided liquidity pools and isolated smart contracts that cannot talk across their blockchain environments. Engineering teams worldwide are trying to deliver a product that allows seamless interchain communication to solve this.
LayerZero is one of these solutions, with an already-functioning product that powers cross-chain bridging on popular decentralized exchanges like Sushiswap and PancakeSwap.
This article will examine LayerZero and how it helps send cross-chain messages.
How does LayerZero Work?
Any cross-chain communication protocol requires an off-chain entity to send messages to and from. However, this creates a centralization risk.
Here's how LayerZero organizes its' …]]></summary>

My idea was to take the Lego approach, which means building something new with existing blocks; in this case, the blocks are already deployed smart contracts you can leverage for your own ideas!
I like the Pudgy Penguin IP and community; they are a source of inspiration for me. A very welcoming and dynamic group of members that maintains three differently deployed contracts. They have the genesis collection of the Pudgy Penguins, the 2nd drop of the Lil Pudgys, and the 3rd drop of the Pudgy Rods(Rogs).
So, I looked at their contracts and got an idea. Why not use the Rogs to go fishing in the Arctic? How would this work? Let's break …]]></summary>

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were joined by co-founders Luke and Kui who gave us an overview of Koinos Account Protocol (KAP).
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kui and Luke are co-founders of the Koinos Account Protocol but previously were on DevNTell showcasing their first project, BurnKoin. Kui is a structural engineer from New York but has a deep passion for web3 that drove him to found KAP with Luke. Luke is a software developer by trade, spending the last decade doing web development but has dived into web3 only in the last couple of years. Fun fact: Luke and Kui have founded two projects together but have never met in real life yet!
🔥 About KAP
From the KAP About Page:
KAP makes it easy to access dApps without buying tokens. You just get a free or premium username and go. Built on the Koinos blockchain, KAP is the backbone of social, gaming, and any other free-to-use dApp. It will evolve to include a host of features that make it easy to experience blockchain for free.

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were given an overview of Aspecta by Chief of Staff Jane Yang.
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Jane is a founding team member of Aspecta, a startup building digital identity for developers. Before joining Aspecta, she studied AI and interned at a venture capital fund where she was first exposed to web3. During grad school, Jane met Aspecta's Founder, Jack, whose company was exclusively AI-focused. However, Jane's insight led her to introduce Jack to web3 and offered to drop out of grad school if the company pivoted accordingly. The rest is now history with Jane acting as Chief of Staff.
🔥 About Aspecta
From the Aspect Docs:
Aspecta ID is an AI-generated identity system, including personal webpages, soul-bound tokens, and digital twins in the metaverse, for pioneering builders, innovators and beyond. The mission of Aspecta ecosystem is to provide safe, user-controllable, and intelligent protocols for users and third-party applications to store, transfer, and utilize data across Web2 & Web3 spaces.
