Recently, I posted on my LinkedIn page about the importance of blockchain education and received a lot of questions from people asking me to explain what blockchain technology is. This shows that many people are still unfamiliar with blockchains or have not heard of them, despite their digital literacy. As much as we may want to blame them for not paying enough attention online, it is not fair to blame these people.  Instead, we should blame those in the industry who have made it appear as though only highly technical people can understand and participate in the space. This is not the case, and it's important to educate more people about the reality of blockchains.

What is the Filecoin Virtual Machine?
Let's start by understanding the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). As a Web3 developer, you may already know that Filecoin is a decentralized storage provider or a peer-to-peer network that stores files with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time, to be exact. Now think of adding a computational layer on the top of Filecoin, that FVM for you.
The FVM unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from programmable storage primitives (such as storage bounties, auctions, and more), to cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g. trustlessly connecting Filecoin with Ethereum, Solana, NEAR, and more), t‚Ä¶]]></summary>

When it came to my turn, I did not have a hard time coming up with an answer. It was back during the end of the 90s, and I was running one of the last bulletin board systems (BBSes) in my hometown of San Diego. For those who may not recall, a BBS was a network pre-Web that ran on dial-up servers. There used to be countless BBSes across the globe spanning every interest area and topic, but as the Web grew, the popularity of the BBS declined. 
A small San Diego publication interviewed me as part of a story on the end of the BBS era, and I was asked in that interview if I thought the Web would make the BBS irrelevant. In my defiant teenage voice, I triumphantly declar‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Writing is a skill you can learn, sharpen, and master through consistent practice over time. All it takes is good resources to learn and to write and read what other writers have written constantly.
Lisa See says, "reading a thousand books will make your words flow like a river".
Are you a lover of emerging technologies, someone who likes to explain things in a way that even a 6-year-old baby can understand? Or are you a developer who loves to share ideas and teach people via written content? Then technical writing is for you. So, let's get started!

In modern-day software development, APIs and SDKs have become essential parts; because they have so much in common, they often get mixed up.
In my opinion, in the first half of 2022, we had an uptrend in Developer Experience (DX), while User Experience (UX) dominated the second half. APIs and SDKs play an essential part in improving both experiences. A well-known SDK is Google SDK for analytics which developers use to get data about user behaviours. We also have Facebook SDK for advertising, which makes it easier for de‚Ä¶]]></summary>
