In this article, we will:
Learn about Scroll zkEVM and how to start with its' Alpha testnet.
Set up a dev environment with Foundry and write a smart contract that dispenses ETH on the Alpha testnet based on a pseudo-random number-generating function.
Tweak the smart contract to fit in with the exact specifications required for the Alpha testnet
Deploy our smart contract with the help of a Solidity script.
Verify our smart contract on the Alpha testnet straight out of Foundry's command line.
By the end of this article, you will learn how to deploy your smart contracts to Scroll's Alpha testnet with Foundry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the need for secure smart contracts. With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.
On top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately. This is where security tools come into play.

In this week's episode of DevNTell, Nasir Jamal (nas) gave us a look at his project, Hashleap: a web3 payments and financial management platform
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Nasir is a software engineer with more than a decade and a half of experience in startups where he held IC and leadership positions. Before HashLeap he cofounded another startup called Rodeo to provide analytics to gig workers for which we raised close to a million dollars led by Seedcamp. He architected and built the first MVP along with the initial engineering team he hired. The company is still going on and his cofounders have gone on to raise another round. Before Rodeo, he was Director of Engineering at Wise and was also one of the first engineers at Deliveroo and helped grow the product team from under 10 to ~400. Throughout his career, he has been involved with early-stage companies with a focus on iterating and delivering products that solve customer problems.
🔥 About Hashleap
From the About section of the Hashleap blog:
Hashleap is on a mission to simplify crypto payments for small businesses, web3 companies or freelancers, DAOs and charities by making it part of their business process rather than a disconnected activity.

Midjourney is just one of many AI image generators that have sprung up recently. But unlike its competitors, Midjourney has a more dream-like and artsy style. It's not just about churning out photos - it's more like a painting tool that can help you create something truly unique. If you're into science-fiction or gothic artwork, then Midjourney is perfect.
