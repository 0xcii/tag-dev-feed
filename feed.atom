In this week's episode of DevNTell, Nico Burkart gave us an overview of Streamr Network
üåü Developer Spotlight
Nico is a DevRel Engineer at Streamr and Data Union DAO. Nico, as with many other Developer DAO members, has a very inspiring story behind his journey into web3. Having sold all his possessions, Nico moved to Madeira to live the digital nomad life in pursuit of a career in web3. After some ups and downs, a brief stint as a web2 dishwasher API engineer and experiencing the wholesome community that is Developer DAO, Nico found his calling in web3 with Streamr Network.
üî• About Streamr Network
From the Streamr Network documentation:
The Streamr Network is a peer-to-peer network for publishing and subscribing to data in real time. Applications use it for decentralized messaging, for example, sharing data across applications or broadcasting real-time state changes to large audiences. The decentralized nature of the system makes the data transport scalable, robust, secure, tamper proof, and censorship-resistant.

However, most programming languages today have either native support for generating random numbers or come with supporting libraries that generate random numbers with an acceptable level of determinism mixed in.
While generating acceptably-random numbers is a mostly solved problem in traditional computing, it is nigh impossible to do so on blockchains.
Yes, you could hash together a bunch of block and transaction data with a keccak256 function, but that is ad-hoc at best and is definitely not production-worthy code today.

In that post, Dr. Wood defines Web3 as a trustless Internet that replaces IP addresses with hashes, accomplishes network connectivity through incentivized peers competing to forward cryptographically signed messages, and lets users interact pseudonymously through a worldwide consensus engine.
Despite being a fascinating read in its own right, his concept of a Web3 didn't take the industry by storm and, for the most part, was all but forgotten.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this article as a technical introduction to the Scroll zkEVM for smart contract developers who want to try out the network.
In this article, we will:
Learn about Scroll zkEVM and how to start with its' Alpha testnet.
Set up a dev environment with Foundry and write a smart contract that dispenses ETH on the Alpha testnet based on a pseudo-random number-generating function.
Tweak the smart contract to fit in with the exact specifications required for the Alpha testnet
Deploy our smart contract with the help of a Solidity script.
Verify our smart contract on the Alpha testnet straight out of Foundry's command line.
By the end of this article, you will learn how to deploy your smart contracts to Scroll's Alpha testnet with Foundry.
What is the Scroll zkEVM?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the need for secure smart contracts. With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.
On top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately. This is where security tools come into play.
