BluePanda, CTO of Eden, asked me to research Arweave for permanently storing endorsement data on a blockchain. This data will be generated as a person is endorsed based on their performance on a project, so long-term storage and immutability are essential. Arweave was a natural fit because it met all the requirements for implementing this feature in Eden. The astonishing thing was how simple it was to put this into action. Thanks to Arweave's clear documentation. In this post, I will share the information I gleaned from that research.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, fren! gm. 
Recently, I worked on an NFT project that required IPFS for storing the NFT images and metadata. That sparked my interest in learning more about decentralized storage, which has fascinated me for a while now.
So, today we're gonna learn about decentralized storage (let's call it DStorage for short) and some of the most popular DStorage protocols in this blog post.
Let's dive in!
What is DStorage?
As its name implies, DStorage is a storage system that does not rely on a central server or authority.
Unlike a centralized storage system managed and operated by a single centralized entity, a peer-to-peer network of user-operated nodes operates DStorage, each of which stores a copy of the data creating a resilient file storage-sharing system.
The decentralization makes it much mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It consists of three components:
Forge: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat, and DappTools).
Cast: CLI for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.
Anvil: local Ethereum node, similar to Ganache or Hardhat Network.
Why Should We Use Foundry?

Its speedy; no more wasted time while running tests.
It allows you to write tests in Solidity, which minimizes context switching.
Many testing features like fuzzing, console.log, and cheat codes give you more power and flexibility.

In this weeks episode of DevNTell, Kai Huang and Gov go over their project, Supercluster Labs
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kai has been in Product Management for the last 6 years, currently working as a PM for MetaMask.  Kai Started working on Supercluster about 4 months ago with the team he formed at HackFS '22 with the goal to provide a super easy decentralized file sharing application.
Gov is a blockchain/web3 developer and researcher who has been in the space since 2014. He has worked on several projects in the space, notably at a venture funded project that developed secure p2p file sharing for governments. In addition, he has participated in several hackathons, notably creating a top 10 hack at HackFS 2020 and winning 2nd place for the IPFS prize at HackFS 2022.
🚀 About Supercluster Labs
Supercluster is a decentralized file sharing solution purpose built for DAOs.  Supercluster Files enables DAOs to share content between team members without having to rely on centralized parties.

"SSX is a library that enables you to easily add user authentication, session management, and more to your dapp."
https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/blob/main/README.md

Okay, But What Is It?
It's an app that allows you to administer authentication sessions for native Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE pronounced see-we) and have a way to see stats on those sessions.

Why Is This Needed?
Abstracting Functionality
Could you build out your own user session manager with SIWE? Yes, you could, but like everything, why would you keep building the same tool systems repeatedly? Just like when services like Auth0 came into the market, we abstracted the need to try to build and manage authentication services.
Easy Implementation
It's also faster to get up and running with sessions without having …]]></summary>

🌟 Developer Spotlight
Patrick Skinner is a Former Special Operations Combat Medic and Mass Casualty Coordinator that later went into software development.  During his time in service, he became highly aware of how often humans are taken advantage of during natural disasters and trafficked for labor, sexual exploitation, and even organ trafficking.  After attempting to take on Human Trafficking head-on and finding that most teams are heavily out-matched, he came up with the idea to target one of their largest funding sources; Counterfeit Products & Pharmaceuticals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, fren! gm. 
This blog post will cover some of the most common ERC token standards you can use to create fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens.
So, without further ado, let's get started!
First of All, WTH is ERC? 🤔
ERC stands for "Ethereum Request for Comments," a proposal document developers write. It is then reviewed by the Ethereum community using a process called "Ethereum Improvement Proposal" or EIP.
What is ERC-20?
ERC-20 is the 20th proposal, which Fabian Vogelsteller proposed in 2015, and Ethereum integrated it in 2017. It is the most commonly used token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.
The tokens created using the ERC-20 standard have three properties:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we will build a custom ERC-1155 NFT bundle collection using Thirdweb ContractKit and Deploy tool. Instead of minting all the NFTs in one go. We allow users to mint NFT from any NFT bundle collection one by one. We also set a maximum supply of NFTs; one user can mint only one NFT.
Overview
ERC-1155 has emerged as a gold standard for creating NFTs; every major marketplace lists new tokens as an ERC-1155 standard. We will use Thirdweb ContractKit to build our smart contract along with some custom logic. We allow users to mint only one NFT per NFT bundle collection. 
Why Use ContractKit?
Each feature you implement in your smart contracts unlocks functionality in both the thirdweb dashboard and SDK to help you build applications on top of them.

I can trace this feeling back to COVID times, but I just noticed it recently. Well, a month or so ago. I saw hints of it after I was sick after returning from Cosmoverse in Medellin, Colombia. I was tired in a way I had never been before. I was tired of having fun. I was tired of talking to my friends, and I was tired of work.
