Even in a vast blockchain network with countless nodes and layers, users need help utilizing the decentralized network's complete potential because DApps use different chains. Some use Ethereum, some Polygon, some Gnosis, and so on!
In this environment, developers should build chain-agnostic applicationsno dependency on one chain and no restriction for any user.
Now, solving this interoperability issue between different chains requires devs to build robust and, more importantly, secure designs, which is a highly technical and resourceful process, and to save devs from going through such pain Hyperlane comes into the picture.
This article will explain almost all about Hyperlane and how it works, so grab a coffee  and LFG 🚀

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were joined by CEO Steffen Kux who gave us an overview of dm3 Protocol
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Steffen Kux is CEO at dm3, the web3 messaging protocol for secure and interoperable communication. He's an applied mathematician with over 20 years of experience in method and software development. Since 2017, he's implemented blockchain technology for real-world applications in IoT, energy, mobility, asset management, and self-sovereign identity.
🔥 About dm3 Protocol
From the dm3 Protocol documentation:
The dm3 (Decentralized Messaging for web3 or Direct Message 3) protocol is an end-2-end encrypted peer-2-peer messaging protocol, rooted in ENS (Ethereum Name Service). It is decentralized, has no single-points-of-failure, has a lean architecture with minimum resource requirements, and enables interoperability with other messaging solutions while preserving the self-sovereignty of its users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I wrote about running an Arweave gateway on GitHub Codespaces for development, but this was just an exercise to get to know AR.IO's gateway node.
Codespaces are short-lived cloud instances that start when we open VSCode in the browser. Nice for development, but not so nice for a real gateway.
Fly.io, or Fly for short, on the other hand, supplies us with short-lived cloud instances that start when someone sends a request to a specific domain - any requests - so it's perfect for a gateway.

It was a fascinating conversation and I learned a lot about seasteading. Seasteading is a concept that involves building permanent human habitation in international waters. The idea […]
