        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamr is a decentralized, real-time data network that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network where each node connects with other nodes without a central server. Streamr uses a publish-subscribe system where one peer writes data to the network, and others read the data. This continuous flow of data allows for efficient and effective real-time data transport and communication.

This tutorial will walk you through the Streamr network and how to get started. We will create a simple Next.js application that will consume data from a public stream and create and write to one. We will plot and visualize this data using a line chart and become acquainted with the Streamr network.
