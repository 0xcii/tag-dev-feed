In this week's episode of DevNTell, Josh Long gave us an overview of Authentication with Lit Protocol
ðŸŒŸ Developer Spotlight
Josh is an engineer in the web3 space with a focus on developer tooling. Having worked for web3 and IoT companies, Josh loves creating developer tooling, and helping others understand complex topics in order to achieve their development goals.
ðŸ”¥ About Lit Protocol
From the Lit Protocol Docs:
Lit Protocol lets you create and manage distributed cryptographic key-pairs for condition-based encryption and programmatic signing. A decentralized key management network, Lit can be used in place of centralized key custodians and other key management solutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believe it or not, the term Web3 was first used in a 2014 blog post by Dr. Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum and creator of the Polkadot network, where he reimagined the Web as a "Secure Social Operating System".
In that post, Dr. Wood defines Web3 as a trustless Internet that replaces IP addresses with hashes, accomplishes network connectivity through incentivized peers competing to forward cryptographically signed messages, and lets users interact pseudonymously through a worldwide consensus engine.
Despite being a fascinating read in its own right, his concept of a Web3 didn't take the industry by storm and, for the most part, was all but forgotten.
It wasn't until really the rise of the NFT in 2021, when the number of unique buyers and sellers rose from around 8,000 to over 1.15 mâ€¦]]></summary>

In this article, we will:
Learn about Scroll zkEVM and how to start with its' Alpha testnet.
Set up a dev environment with Foundry and write a smart contract that dispenses ETH on the Alpha testnet based on a pseudo-random number-generating function.
Tweak the smart contract to fit in with the exact specifications required for the Alpha testnet
Deploy our smart contract with the help of a Solidity script.
Verify our smart contract on the Alpha testnet straight out of Foundry's command line.
By the end of this article, you will learn how to deploy your smart contracts to Scroll's Alpha testnet with Foundry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the need for secure smart contracts. With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.
On top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately. This is where security tools come into play.
