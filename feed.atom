APIs and SDKs play an essential part in improving both experiences. A well-known SDK is Google SDK for analytics which developers use to get data about user behaviours.

We will use thirdweb ContractKit for the ERC-721 token standard, thirdweb deploy to deploy our smart contract to Mumbai Testnet, and Chainlink Data Feeds to fetch the realtime price of Matic to set the base price for minting NFT. We will build and deploy a smart contract that allows users to mint NFT. The user has to pay at least $1 in Matic to mint the NFT. We get the actual price conversion using Chainlink Data Feeds.
What is ERC-721?
ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.
The ERC-721 introduces a standard fo…]]></summary>

🧠 About Storedat
Storedat is a GraphQL API built on top of existing web3 storage providers like Arweave and Filecoin. We exist to accelerate the adoption of decentralized storage by providing a provider agnostic way to read and write data with those protocols all the while abstracting away web3 from the user. No dealing with wallets, signing transactions, storing private keys, paying transaction costs, and so on.
Just plug in and Storedat
