        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating truly random numbers on a computer is a complex mathematical problem. However, most programming languages today have either native support for generating random numbers or come with supporting libraries that generate random numbers with an acceptable level of determinism mixed in.
While generating acceptably-random numbers is a mostly solved problem in traditional computing, it is nigh impossible to do so on blockchains.

Yes, you could hash together a bunch of block and transaction data with a keccak256 function, but that is ad-hoc at best and is definitely not production-worthy code today.
If you've been in Web3 for any reasonable amount of time, you have undoubtedly heard of Chainlink.
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that feeds a variety of data to blockchains in â€¦]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believe it or not, the term Web3 was first used in a 2014 blog post by Dr. Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum and creator of the Polkadot network, where he reimagined the Web as a "Secure Social Operating System".

In that post, Dr. Wood defines Web3 as a trustless Internet that replaces IP addresses with hashes, accomplishes network connectivity through incentivized peers competing to forward cryptographically signed messages, and lets users interact pseudonymously through a worldwide consensus engine.
Despite being a fascinating read in its own right, his concept of a Web3 didn't take the industry by storm and, for the most part, was all but forgotten.
It wasn't until really the rise of the NFT in 2021, when the number of unique buyers and sellers rose from around 8,000 to over 1.15 â€¦]]></summary>
