In this weeks episode of DevNTell, DAO member Gery Pollak presents an overview of Blocktorch: observability for the decentralized stack
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Gery has 6 years experience working in business development at FAANG and investing in startups in central & eastern Europe as a VC. He is a self taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer. 
🔥 About Blocktorch
Blocktorch's mission is to build an end-to-end web3 observability platform to support engineers building dApps, similar to what DataDog achieved for the cloud but with a focus on decentralized backend architecture

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, fren! gm. 
Recently, I worked on an NFT project that required IPFS for storing the NFT images and metadata. That sparked my interest in learning more about decentralized storage, which has fascinated me for a while now.
So, today we're gonna learn about decentralized storage (let's call it DStorage for short) and some of the most popular DStorage protocols in this blog post.
Let's dive in!
What is DStorage?
As its name implies, DStorage is a storage system that does not rely on a central server or authority.
Unlike a centralized storage system managed and operated by a single centralized entity, a peer-to-peer network of user-operated nodes operates DStorage, each of which stores a copy of the data creating a resilient file storage-sharing system.
The decentralization makes it much mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It consists of three components:
Forge: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat, and DappTools).
Cast: CLI for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data.
Anvil: local Ethereum node, similar to Ganache or Hardhat Network.
Why Should We Use Foundry?

Its speedy; no more wasted time while running tests.
It allows you to write tests in Solidity, which minimizes context switching.
Many testing features like fuzzing, console.log, and cheat codes give you more power and flexibility.

In this weeks episode of DevNTell, Kai Huang and Gov go over their project, Supercluster Labs
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kai has been in Product Management for the last 6 years, currently working as a PM for MetaMask.  Kai Started working on Supercluster about 4 months ago with the team he formed at HackFS '22 with the goal to provide a super easy decentralized file sharing application.
Gov is a blockchain/web3 developer and researcher who has been in the space since 2014. He has worked on several projects in the space, notably at a venture funded project that developed secure p2p file sharing for governments. In addition, he has participated in several hackathons, notably creating a top 10 hack at HackFS 2020 and winning 2nd place for the IPFS prize at HackFS 2022.
🚀 About Supercluster Labs
Supercluster is a decentralized file sharing solution purpose built for DAOs.  Supercluster Files enables DAOs to share content between team members without having to rely on centralized parties.

"SSX is a library that enables you to easily add user authentication, session management, and more to your dapp."
https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/blob/main/README.md

Okay, But What Is It?
It's an app that allows you to administer authentication sessions for native Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE pronounced see-we) and have a way to see stats on those sessions.

Why Is This Needed?
Abstracting Functionality
Could you build out your own user session manager with SIWE? Yes, you could, but like everything, why would you keep building the same tool systems repeatedly? Just like when services like Auth0 came into the market, we abstracted the need to try to build and manage authentication services.
Easy Implementation
It's also faster to get up and running with sessions without having …]]></summary>

Lens Protocol allows developers to plug a well-connected social graph into any application without the need to onboard users and fill out profiles. The same team who brought you AAVE Protocol also built Lens Protocol. Lens' mission promises to provide the last social media handle you will ever need. You can find me on it at @ntindle.lens.
The ability to quickly and easily source a social graph cannot be understated.
