At least the Warpcast app works in the browser after completing the registration process, so why not try it? Especially with all the hype around Frames. And when Im already on it, why not write a few words about it?
So, here it is, yet another Farcaster Frames explainer for you!
What are Farcaster Frames?
Technically, Frames are an extension of the Open Graph protocol (OGP) but a peculiar one, as you can use OGP features just as a fallback and not mix them.
In practice, you use the fc:frame or the og: metatags. This is a bit strange, as it doesnt all…]]></summary>

That brought a new dawn, a new way of raising funds that prioritizes the voice and needs of the majority over the minority big-holder investor.
Quadratic funding (QF) is the new way of fundraising in Web3. The time of crowdfunding is over!
In this article, you will learn the aim behind QF and the potential opportunities embedded in it.
Sit back and enjoy reading!

Recently, I have been using very simple sketches created in Figma to influence my Midjourney prompts, and the results are amazing.
First, you can do this with Photoshop, Illustration, Canva, or other toolseven drawn sketches. However, for this tutorial, we'll be using Figma. If you want to learn more about Midjourney, check out my Beginner's Guide and Complete Guide to Image Effects.

In recent years, blockchain ecosystems have tried to improve onboarding to get a hold of the UX part, but as many new chains sprouted, the technical complexities grew with them.
Account abstraction solves key management quite nicely. When a smart contract can decide when TXs are valid, nobody needs to juggle keys anymore, but wouldnt it be nice if we could abstract away the different chains altogether? NEAR leverages account abstraction, modular data availability, cross-chain liquidity networks, and composable decentralized frontends for chain interoperabilityone account for all chains.
