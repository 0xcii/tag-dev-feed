        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🌈 GM
In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were joined by Josh Stein and Dev Bear who gave us an overview of how to deploy a rollup with a Celestia Light Node.
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Josh is a tech enthusiast who likes building with and playing with the latest gadgets and software. Hes on the DevRel team at Celestia Labs and will be sharing more about modular blockchains. When hes not at the computer, he likes biking, swimming, and bouldering.  
Dev Bear is a software engineer at heart having previously held a Senior Software Engineering role at Apple; however, he left his position to co-found Bearchain: A DeFi-focused EVM-compatible L1 built on the Cosmos SDK, powered by Proof of Liquidity Consensus. Dev works closely with Josh and some other Celestia folks on integrating Bearchains EVM framework.
🔥 About Celestia
From the Celestia Docs:
Celestia is a modular blockchain network whose goal is to build a scalable data availability layer, enabling the next generation of scalable blockchain architectures - modular blockchains. Celestia scales by decoupling execution from consensus and introducing a new primitive, data availability sampling

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were given an overview of Aspecta by Chief of Staff Jane Yang.
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Jane is a founding team member of Aspecta, a startup building digital identity for developers. Before joining Aspecta, she studied AI and interned at a venture capital fund where she was first exposed to web3. During grad school, Jane met Aspecta's Founder, Jack, whose company was exclusively AI-focused. However, Jane's insight led her to introduce Jack to web3 and offered to drop out of grad school if the company pivoted accordingly. The rest is now history with Jane acting as Chief of Staff.
🔥 About Aspecta
From the Aspect Docs:
Aspecta ID is an AI-generated identity system, including personal webpages, soul-bound tokens, and digital twins in the metaverse, for pioneering builders, innovators and beyond. The mission of Aspecta ecosystem is to provide safe, user-controllable, and intelligent protocols for users and third-party applications to store, transfer, and utilize data across Web2 & Web3 spaces.

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were given an overview of Bifrost by Co-Founders Kartik (CEO) and Samraaj (CTO).
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Kartik and Samraaj are long-time friends who first met at RIT and then eventually became co-founders together. They started their first business in web3 by creating a smart contract based deadman switch which helped land both of them into Y-Combinator. After a while, they realized that the market conditions weren't quite right for that product to take off and turned to another project that Samraaj had been working on a few years ago. That product was the non-AI version of Bifrost which, at the time, didn't scale since machine-generated code was still relatively new; however, with the recent advancements in AI and after its incorporation into Bifrost, they quickly went viral after releasing their first demo video. They're on a mission to remove all the monotonous work of implementing design so that engineers can focus on the fun stuff!
🔥 About Bifrost
Bifrost uses AI to turn your Figma designs into clean React code  automatically. It's the first design-to-code product that works!

In this week's episode of DevNTell, we were given an overview of ChainBrain by Founder and CEO Marissa Posner.
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Marissa is the founder and CEO of ChainBrain, a Web3 business intelligence tool that allows business users to search, visualize, and take action on real-time changes in blockchain data.
Marissa first got into Web3 through trading and being a data scientist, she was naturally interested in digging into the data around tokens and NFTs. After some exploration, she soon realized the complexity behind the analysis of the data. Thus, the seeds of inspiration were laid for ChainBrain to take shape. Leveraging her deep expertise in Machine Learning, she splits her time between the dynamic hubs of NYC and Tel Aviv while building ChainBrain.
🔥 About ChainBrain
ChainBrain is a Web3 business intelligence tool for real-time analytics, predictions, and executable on-chain actions. Users can visualize any on-chain data through dashboards and charts.
