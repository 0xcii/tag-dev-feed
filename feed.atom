In this week's episode of DevNTell, Giancarlo gave us an overview of Webstudio: a drag-and-drop website 3.0 builder
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Giancarlo is a software engineer from Venezuela and founder of Webstudio, a no-code decentralized website builder. Giancarlo is passionate about bringing the benefits of Web 3.0 to the masses. Before Webstudio, he worked as a manager and engineer at Amazon, where he gained valuable experience in tech and leadership and had the privilege of working with outstanding folks. Before that, he was a founding engineer at Glofox, a fitness software company in Ireland. Giancarlo is excited to be a part of the Web3 space so that he can contribute to building a more decentralized and democratized Internet where people have more control over their data, finances, and ultimately their lives.
🔥 About Webstudio
Webstudio is a drag-and-drop website 3.0 builder featuring 250+ UI blocks and 10+ pre-built templates powered by TailwindCSS. Sites are deployed in the Interplanetary File System for resilient and tamper-proof, peer-to-peer sharing even in areas with slow or limited connectivity.

Biconomy's robust SDK uses account abstraction (EIP 4337) to provide various features. Be it by allowing users to make smart wallets with their Gmail account or by sending transactions with no pop-ups. It has helped countless DApps increase their users by 10x and existing "Web2" apps to provide Web3 features to their users.

In this week's episode of DevNTell, Nico Burkart gave us an overview of Streamr Network
🌟 Developer Spotlight
Nico is a DevRel Engineer at Streamr and Data Union DAO. Nico, as with many other Developer DAO members, has a very inspiring story behind his journey into web3. Having sold all his possessions, Nico moved to Madeira to live the digital nomad life in pursuit of a career in web3. After some ups and downs, a brief stint as a web2 dishwasher API engineer and experiencing the wholesome community that is Developer DAO, Nico found his calling in web3 with Streamr Network.
🔥 About Streamr Network
From the Streamr Network documentation:
The Streamr Network is a peer-to-peer network for publishing and subscribing to data in real time. Applications use it for decentralized messaging, for example, sharing data across applications or broadcasting real-time state changes to large audiences. The decentralized nature of the system makes the data transport scalable, robust, secure, tamper proof, and censorship-resistant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating truly random numbers on a computer is a complex mathematical problem. However, most programming languages today have either native support for generating random numbers or come with supporting libraries that generate random numbers with an acceptable level of determinism mixed in.
While generating acceptably-random numbers is a mostly solved problem in traditional computing, it is nigh impossible to do so on blockchains.

Yes, you could hash together a bunch of block and transaction data with a keccak256 function, but that is ad-hoc at best and is definitely not production-worthy code today.
If you've been in Web3 for any reasonable amount of time, you have undoubtedly heard of Chainlink.
