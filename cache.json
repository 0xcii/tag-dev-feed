Moreover, the onboarding process can be tedious and confusing, with users having to set up and manage wallets and acquire cryptocurrency to interact with the marketplace. To address these issues and make NFT marketplaces more accessible to non-web3 users, it's essential to focus on improving UX.\nIn this guide, youll learn how to create a marketplace on Polygon and make it easy for non-crypto natives to use the marketplace by allowing them to log in with their emai…",
