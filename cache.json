Hyperlane is a permissionless protocol, which means you can deploy your own Hyperlane on any chain without asking the core team. In this guide, you will learn how to deploy Hyperlane on Polygon zkEVM Testnet, Polygon Mumbai Testnet and Sepolia.\nThere are five steps we need to follow so LFG🚀\n\nPrerequisites\nYarn\nGit and GitHub knowledge\nUnderstanding of blockchain\nOptional: Solidity experience\n1.

          "description": "Arweave allows for decentralized data storage. Users pay a one-time fee to upload their data and are guaranteed permanent storage. Miners ensure data permanence by storing and replicating data in exchange for Arweave's native AR token. You can think of Arweave as a global hard disk or a decentralized Amazon S3.\nThis article explains how to upload files to Arweave using the Bundlr Network. You will learn what the Bundlr Network is and how it makes data upload to Arweave seamless. You will create a simple NextJS application to upload and view the images uploaded to Arweave, so sit back, relax, and let's get this adventure started. 🚀\n\nWhat is the Bundlr Network?\nBundlr is a scaling solution for Arweave that makes it easier to upload data.
