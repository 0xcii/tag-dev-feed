Before HashLeap he cofounded another startup called Rodeo to provide analytics to gig workers for which we raised close to a million dollars led by Seedcamp. He architected and built the first MVP along with the initial engineering team he hired. The company is still going on and his cofounders have gone on to raise another round. Before Rodeo, he was Director of Engineering at Wise and was also one of the first engineers at Deliveroo and helped grow the product team from under 10 to ~400. Throughout his career, he has been involved with early-stage companies with a focus on iterating and delivering products that solve customer problems.\n🔥 About Hashleap\nFrom the About section of the Hashleap blog:\nHashleap is on a mission to simplify crypto payments for small businesses, web3 companies or freelancers, DAOs and charities by making it part of their business process rather than a disconnected activity.\nWebsite: https://hashleap.io/\nBlog: https://blog.hashleap.io/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_nasj\nNasir's Twitter: https://twitter.com/hashleap\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z8q40POKiY",

He is a self-taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer.\n🔥 About Blocktorch\nFrom the About page of Blocktorch:\nThe number of decentralized applications, their developers as well as users are growing at rapid speed, yet the tooling around web3 is not evolving fast enough. The underlying decentralized architecture is getting more complex and less understandable. To ensure web3 is mass market ready reliability is key.  The talented engineering teams pushing the frontiers of innovation need the best tools to build the best products.  \nWe at Blocktorch are re-imagining how developers build and maintain their decentralized applications. We believe in empowering every software engineering team to gain a deeper understanding of their smart contracts as well as other decentralized components such that they can troubleshoot and resolve anomalies in minutes, not hours.\nWebsite: blocktorch.xyz\nTwitter: twitter.com/blocktorch\nGery's Twitter: twitter.com/GeryPollak\nGery's Discord handle: CapG(blocktorch.xyz)#9916\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpQ3_Atfnw",
