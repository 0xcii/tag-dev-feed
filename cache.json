          "description": "Arweave allows for decentralized data storage. Users pay a one-time fee to upload their data and are guaranteed permanent storage. Miners ensure data permanence by storing and replicating data in exchange for Arweave's native AR token. You can think of Arweave as a global hard disk or a decentralized Amazon S3.\nThis article explains how to upload files to Arweave using the Bundlr Network. You will learn what the Bundlr Network is and how it makes data upload to Arweave seamless. You will create a simple NextJS application to upload and view the images uploaded to Arweave, so sit back, relax, and let's get this adventure started. 🚀\n\nWhat is the Bundlr Network?\nBundlr is a scaling solution for Arweave that makes it easier to upload data.

He's an applied mathematician with over 20 years of experience in method and software development. Since 2017, he's implemented blockchain technology for real-world applications in IoT, energy, mobility, asset management, and self-sovereign identity.\n🔥 About dm3 Protocol\nFrom the dm3 Protocol documentation:\nThe dm3 (Decentralized Messaging for web3 or Direct Message 3) protocol is an end-2-end encrypted peer-2-peer messaging protocol, rooted in ENS (Ethereum Name Service). It is decentralized, has no single-points-of-failure, has a lean architecture with minimum resource requirements, and enables interoperability with other messaging solutions while preserving the self-sovereignty of its users.\nResources:\n dm3 Website\n dm3 Protocol Twitter\n dm3 linktree\n🤝 Guest\nSteffen: https://twitter.com/SteffenKux\n\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVjGN2hJtGY",
