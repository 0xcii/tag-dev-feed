They started their first business in web3 by creating a smart contract based deadman switch which helped land both of them into Y-Combinator. After a while, they realized that the market conditions weren't quite right for that product to take off and turned to another project that Samraaj had been working on a few years ago. That product was the non-AI version of Bifrost which, at the time, didn't scale since machine-generated code was still relatively new; however, with the recent advancements in AI and after its incorporation into Bifrost, they quickly went viral after releasing their first demo video. They're on a mission to remove all the monotonous work of implementing design so that engineers can focus on the fun stuff!\n🔥 About Bifrost\nBifrost uses AI to turn your Figma designs into clean React code  automatically. It's the first design-to-code product that works!\nResources:\nBifrost: https://www.bifrost.so/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bifrostcode\nKartik's Twitter: https://twitter.com/sathaxe\nSamraaj's Twitter: https://twitter.com/samraaj\n\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-V_OxKT4yI",
