Some use Ethereum, some Polygon, some Gnosis, and so on!\nIn this environment, developers should build chain-agnostic applicationsno dependency on one chain and no restriction for any user.\nNow, solving this interoperability issue between different chains requires devs to build robust and, more importantly, secure designs, which is a highly technical and resourceful process, and to save devs from going through such pain Hyperlane comes into the picture.\nThis article will explain almost all about Hyperlane and how it works, so grab a coffee  and LFG 🚀\n\nWhat is Hyperlane?\nHyperlane is a permissionless inter…",

He's an applied mathematician with over 20 years of experience in method and software development. Since 2017, he's implemented blockchain technology for real-world applications in IoT, energy, mobility, asset management, and self-sovereign identity.\n🔥 About dm3 Protocol\nFrom the dm3 Protocol documentation:\nThe dm3 (Decentralized Messaging for web3 or Direct Message 3) protocol is an end-2-end encrypted peer-2-peer messaging protocol, rooted in ENS (Ethereum Name Service). It is decentralized, has no single-points-of-failure, has a lean architecture with minimum resource requirements, and enables interoperability with other messaging solutions while preserving the self-sovereignty of its users.\nResources:\n dm3 Website\n dm3 Protocol Twitter\n dm3 linktree\n🤝 Guest\nSteffen: https://twitter.com/SteffenKux\n\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVjGN2hJtGY",

Nice for development, but not so nice for a real gateway.\nFly.io, or Fly for short, on the other hand, supplies us with short-lived cloud instances that start when someone sends a request to a specific domain - any requests - so it's perfect for a gateway.\nBut first, we must take a few hurdles to get things up and running.\nSo, let's dive in!\nTarget Audience\nThis article assumes you know how to use the command line on Linux.
