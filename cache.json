          "description": "The rich get richer every day, even when it comes to grant programs; however, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, thinks that for Web3 to be truly democratic, grant fundraising should also be democratic.\nThat brought a new dawn, a new way of raising funds that prioritizes the voice and needs of the majority over the minority big-holder investor.\nQuadratic funding (QF) is the new way of fundraising in Web3. The time of crowdfunding is over!\nIn this article, you will learn the aim behind QF and the potential opportunities embedded in it.\nSit back and enjoy reading!\n\nHistory of Quadratic Funding\n\nUnsplash: Joanna\nWe must first trace its origins to understand QF (a.k.a plural funding).

          "description": "One of the most overlooked features of Midjourney is the ability to include images in your /imagine prompt. This gives you the power to influence a prompt's basic visual structure. The more details this image has, the more it will influence your result.\nRecently, I have been using very simple sketches created in Figma to influence my Midjourney prompts, and the results are amazing.\nFirst, you can do this with Photoshop, Illustration, Canva, or other toolseven drawn sketches. However, for this tutorial, we'll be using Figma. If you want to learn more about Midjourney, check out my Beginner's Guide and Complete Guide to Image Effects.\nStep 1: Background\nLet's get started by creating a frame in Figma with the same shape as the image we want to make. In this case, we are using the 16:9 format …",

          "description": "Web3 gives users more control over their data and payments. Still, we pay for these benefits with increased technical and UX complexity. In recent years, blockchain ecosystems have tried to improve onboarding to get a hold of the UX part, but as many new chains sprouted, the technical complexities grew with them.\nAccount abstraction solves key management quite nicely. When a smart contract can decide when TXs are valid, nobody needs to juggle keys anymore, but wouldnt it be nice if we could abstract away the different chains altogether? NEAR leverages account abstraction, modular data availability, cross-chain liquidity networks, and composable decentralized frontends for chain interoperabilityone account for all chains.\nThis article explains what chain abstraction means in practice and ho…",
