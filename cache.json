Hes currently working on 0xCord, a web3 infra hub for developers.\n🔥 About 0xCord\n0xCord.com is a web3 infra hub for developers. It's the easiest way to access web3 infrastructure via native payments, composability, and configuration, all in one unified place. With 0xCord's off-chain API, you can easily consume the Chainlink VRF V2 through a simple RESTful JSON API call, bridging the gap between web2 and decentralized web3 infrastructure.
