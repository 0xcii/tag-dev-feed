With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.\nOn top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately.
