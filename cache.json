          "description": "Writing smart contracts for Bitcoin was limited in the past, but with Stacks, this changed. Its Clarity programming language allows you to build Bitcoin smart contacts similar to those on the Ethereum network while being more secure than Solidity at the same time. At first glance, Clarity might seem a bit foreign, but the language has many similarities with Solidity, so don't get discouraged by its syntax.\nThis article adds to our first Stacks workshop with Hiro, where we compared the two languages.\nWhat is Stacks?\nStacks is a layer-2 blockchain network for Bitcoin that reads data from Bitcoin, settles on Bitcoin, and allows the creation of smart contracts similar to the ones on Ethereum.\nBesides being a smart contract platform, Stacks also offers several features and services you might kn…",

          "description": "This tutorial shows how to create a token-gated website using Clarity as the smart contract language. A token-gated website serves content to users with a certain amount of tokens in their wallets.\nIn this tutorial, we will create two Clarity smart contracts, FanToken and TokenGatedCommunity. Holders of the FanToken can join a community on-chain in the TokenGatedCommunity contract, and our frontend will serve users different content based on membership in the TokenGatedCommunity.\nThe diagram below illustrates the functionalities of the smart contracts we will be creating.\n\nWe will get up and running quickly on the front end by creating a NextJS application using a Stack.js template.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe author assumes the following prerequisites:\n\nA beginner understanding of Clarity smart co…",
