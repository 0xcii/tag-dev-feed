          "description": "As a software or web developer, you will work with different components, some of which you will use more often, like application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) mainly because developers are keen to improve the software development cycles. In modern-day software development, APIs and SDKs have become essential parts; because they have so much in common, they often get mixed up.\nIn my opinion, in the first half of 2022, we had an uptrend in Developer Experience (DX), while User Experience (UX) dominated the second half. APIs and SDKs play an essential part in improving both experiences. A well-known SDK is Google SDK for analytics which developers use to get data about user behaviours. We also have Facebook SDK for advertising, which makes it easier for de…",

We will use thirdweb ContractKit for the ERC-721 token standard, thirdweb deploy to deploy our smart contract to Mumbai Testnet, and Chainlink Data Feeds to fetch the realtime price of Matic to set the base price for minting NFT. We will build and deploy a smart contract that allows users to mint NFT. The user has to pay at least $1 in Matic to mint the NFT. We get the actual price conversion using Chainlink Data Feeds.\nWhat is ERC-721?\nERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.\nThe ERC-721 introduces a standard fo…",

We're developing artificial intelligence to match the right people to the right opportunities at the right time. \nBluePanda, CTO of Eden, asked me to research Arweave for permanently storing endorsement data on a blockchain. This data will be generated as a person is endorsed based on their performance on a project, so long-term storage and immutability are essential. Arweave was a natural fit because it met all the requirements for implementing this feature in Eden. The astonishing thing was how simple it was to put this into action. Thanks to Arweave's clear documentation. In this post, I will share the information I gleaned from that research.…",
