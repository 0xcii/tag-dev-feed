          "description": "Bitcoin is the highest-valued token on the planet, but building on the Bitcoin network was a hassle in the past; as the first blockchain, its support for smart contract development and apps was very basic. This changed with the rise of Bitcoin layer-2 networks like Stacks, which come with powerful smart contract platforms. \nIn the previous article, you learned the differences between Solidity and Clarity, the programming language used on Stacks. In this article, you will learn how to build smart contracts with Clarity on Stacks and send contract events to a web server with the Chainhook service. All powered by the Hiro Platform.\nIf you prefer video, check out our workshop with Hiro on YouTube; it contains the same content.\nPrerequisites\n\nA Bitcoin wallet that can interact with the Stacks n…",

          "description": "Writing smart contracts for Bitcoin was limited in the past, but with Stacks, this changed. Its Clarity programming language allows you to build Bitcoin smart contacts similar to those on the Ethereum network while being more secure than Solidity at the same time. At first glance, Clarity might seem a bit foreign, but the language has many similarities with Solidity, so don't get discouraged by its syntax.\nThis article adds to our first Stacks workshop with Hiro, where we compared the two languages.\nWhat is Stacks?\nStacks is a layer-2 blockchain network for Bitcoin that reads data from Bitcoin, settles on Bitcoin, and allows the creation of smart contracts similar to the ones on Ethereum.\nBesides being a smart contract platform, Stacks also offers several features and services you might kn…",

A token-gated website serves content to users with a certain amount of tokens in their wallets.\nIn this tutorial, we will create two Clarity smart contracts, FanToken and TokenGatedCommunity. Holders of the FanToken can join a community on-chain in the TokenGatedCommunity contract, and our frontend will serve users different content based on membership in the TokenGatedCommunity.\nThe diagram below illustrates the functionalities of the smart contracts we will be creating.\n\nWe will get up and running quickly on the front end by creating a NextJS application using a Stack.js template.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe author assumes the following prerequisites:\n\nA beginner understanding of Clarity smart co…",
