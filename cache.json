          "description": "As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the need for secure smart contracts. With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.\nOn top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately. This is where security tools come into play.\nSecurity best practices ad…",

He is a self-taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer.\n🔥 About Blocktorch\nFrom the About page of Blocktorch:\nThe number of decentralized applications, their developers as well as users are growing at rapid speed, yet the tooling around web3 is not evolving fast enough. The underlying decentralized architecture is getting more complex and less understandable. To ensure web3 is mass market ready reliability is key.  The talented engineering teams pushing the frontiers of innovation need the best tools to build the best products.  \nWe at Blocktorch are re-imagining how developers build and maintain their decentralized applications.
