          "description": "🌈 GM\nIn this week's episode of DevNTell, we were given an overview of Aspecta by Chief of Staff Jane Yang.\n🌟 Developer Spotlight\nJane is a founding team member of Aspecta, a startup building digital identity for developers. Before joining Aspecta, she studied AI and interned at a venture capital fund where she was first exposed to web3. During grad school, Jane met Aspecta's Founder, Jack, whose company was exclusively AI-focused. However, Jane's insight led her to introduce Jack to web3 and offered to drop out of grad school if the company pivoted accordingly.

They started their first business in web3 by creating a smart contract based deadman switch which helped land both of them into Y-Combinator. After a while, they realized that the market conditions weren't quite right for that product to take off and turned to another project that Samraaj had been working on a few years ago. That product was the non-AI version of Bifrost which, at the time, didn't scale since machine-generated code was still relatively new; however, with the recent advancements in AI and after its incorporation into Bifrost, they quickly went viral after releasing their first demo video. They're on a mission to remove all the monotonous work of implementing design so that engineers can focus on the fun stuff!\n🔥 About Bifrost\nBifrost uses AI to turn your Figma designs into clean React code  automatically.
