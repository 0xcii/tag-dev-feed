We will talk about Stacks, a Bitcoin layer 2, and how it will unlock $500B+ of Bitcoin liquidity for everyday apps.\nSince 2020s DeFi Summer, we have seen an explosion of smart contract-enabled applications and user experiencesDEXs, AMMs, lending protocols, NFT marketplaces, and morethat now define Web3 and crypto.\nHowever, Bitcoin has not seen this innovation because building on Bitcoin is hard. Bitcoin Script is an incredibly limited language. That makes Bitcoin very securegreat for a store of value and digital currencybut it comes at the cost of programmability. You can't build apps and smart contracts directly on Bitcoin, but that is changing.\nWe've seen…",
