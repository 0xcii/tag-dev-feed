          "description": "Cross-chain communication is one of the hottest topics in Web3 today. There are many blockchains in Web3, meaning divided liquidity pools and isolated smart contracts that cannot talk across their blockchain environments. Engineering teams worldwide are trying to deliver a product that allows seamless interchain communication to solve this.\nLayerZero is one of these solutions, with an already-functioning product that powers cross-chain bridging on popular decentralized exchanges like Sushiswap and PancakeSwap.\nThis article will examine LayerZero and how it helps send cross-chain messages.\nHow does LayerZero Work?\nAny cross-chain communication protocol requires an off-chain entity to send messages to and from. However, this creates a centralization risk.\nHere's how LayerZero organizes its' …",

My idea was to take the Lego approach, which means building something new with existing blocks; in this case, the blocks are already deployed smart contracts you can leverage for your own ideas!\nI like the Pudgy Penguin IP and community; they are a source of inspiration for me. A very welcoming and dynamic group of members that maintains three differently deployed contracts. They have the genesis collection of the Pudgy Penguins, the 2nd drop of the Lil Pudgys, and the 3rd drop of the Pudgy Rods(Rogs).\nSo, I looked at their contracts and got an idea.
