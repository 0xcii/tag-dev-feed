Considering this, it makes perfect sense to take your testing from Goerli to Sepolia.\n1. Updating the RPC node\nThe first step for migrating your DApp is to get the RPC node of the new test network. For our example, we will use the Sepolia test network and QuickNode as the node provider.\nGo to their RPC Endpoints Service section by clicking on this link and click on the \"Create an endpoint\" button.\n\nSelect the chain.
