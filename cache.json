After some exploration, she soon realized the complexity behind the analysis of the data. Thus, the seeds of inspiration were laid for ChainBrain to take shape. Leveraging her deep expertise in Machine Learning, she splits her time between the dynamic hubs of NYC and Tel Aviv while building ChainBrain.\n🔥 About ChainBrain\nChainBrain is a Web3 business intelligence tool for real-time analytics, predictions, and executable on-chain actions. Users can visualize any on-chain data through dashboards and charts.\nResources:\nChainBrain link: https://chainbrain.vercel.app/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/chainbrainapp\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emntsJshpkQ",
