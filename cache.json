Now think of adding a computational layer on the top of Filecoin, that FVM for you.\nThe FVM unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from programmable storage primitives (such as storage bounties, auctions, and more), to cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g. trustlessly connecting Filecoin with Ethereum, Solana, NEAR, and more), t…",

          "description": "At a recent lunch with friends, someone asked everyone to share the worst advice or prediction they have given in their lives. When it came to my turn, I did not have a hard time coming up with an answer. It was back during the end of the 90s, and I was running one of the last bulletin board systems (BBSes) in my hometown of San Diego. For those who may not recall, a BBS was a network pre-Web that ran on dial-up servers. There used to be countless BBSes across the globe spanning every interest area and topic, but as the Web grew, the popularity of the BBS declined. \nA small San Diego publication interviewed me as part of a story on the end of the BBS era, and I was asked in that interview if I thought the Web would make the BBS irrelevant. In my defiant teenage voice, I triumphantly declar…",

In modern-day software development, APIs and SDKs have become essential parts; because they have so much in common, they often get mixed up.\nIn my opinion, in the first half of 2022, we had an uptrend in Developer Experience (DX), while User Experience (UX) dominated the second half. APIs and SDKs play an essential part in improving both experiences. A well-known SDK is Google SDK for analytics which developers use to get data about user behaviours.

We will build and deploy a smart contract that allows users to mint NFT. The user has to pay at least $1 in Matic to mint the NFT. We get the actual price conversion using Chainlink Data Feeds.\nWhat is ERC-721?\nERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
