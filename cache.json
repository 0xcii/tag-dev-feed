The Infura NFT SDK wraps REST calls to Ethereum nodes, abstracting away the technical compilations and making it possible to work with NFTs with just an Infura account, some configuration, and a few lines of code. The Infura NFT SDK also doesn't require the overhead of learning Solidity, importing ABIs, etc. Whether new to Web3 or highly experienced, Infura NFT SDK makes NFTs easy.\nLet's jump in, build, and deploy an ERC721 NFT to see how it works.\nWhat is the Infura NFT SDK?\nThe Infura NFT SDK is an SDK that allows you to build and interact with NFTs easily.

This shows that many people are still unfamiliar with blockchains or have not heard of them, despite their digital literacy. As much as we may want to blame them for not paying enough attention online, it is not fair to blame these people.  Instead, we should blame those in the industry who have made it appear as though only highly technical people can understand and participate in the space.

Now think of adding a computational layer on the top of Filecoin, that FVM for you.\nThe FVM unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from programmable storage primitives (such as storage bounties, auctions, and more), to cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g. trustlessly connecting Filecoin with Ethereum, Solana, NEAR, and more), t…",

There used to be countless BBSes across the globe spanning every interest area and topic, but as the Web grew, the popularity of the BBS declined. \nA small San Diego publication interviewed me as part of a story on the end of the BBS era, and I was asked in that interview if I thought the Web would make the BBS irrelevant.
