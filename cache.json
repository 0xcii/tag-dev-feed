Miners ensure data permanence by storing and replicating data in exchange for Arweave's native AR token. You can think of Arweave as a global hard disk or a decentralized Amazon S3.\nThis article explains how to upload files to Arweave using IRYS. You will learn what Irys is and how it makes data upload to Arweave seamless. You will create a simple NextJS application to upload and view the images uploaded to Arweave, so sit back, relax, and let's get this adventure started. 🚀\n\nWhat is Irys?\nIrys, formerly known as Bundlr, is a provenance layer on Arweave.
