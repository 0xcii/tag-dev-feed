You will fetch NFT data with icy-nft-tools.\n\nWhat is QuickNode?\nQuickNode is a blockchain platform that provides infrastructure for developers to build and scale decentralized applications (DApps). It offers a suite of tools and services, including a developer API, to make it easier for developers to build, test, and deploy DApps on multiple blockchain networks. QuickNode aims to simplify the building process on blockchain and make it more accessible for developers while providing high-performance infrastructure to supp…",

          "description": "🌈 GM\nIn this week's episode of DevNTell, DAO member Gery Pollak gives us an updated look at Blocktorch: an observability platform that helps builders understand the behavior of a decentralized application holistically.\n🌟 Developer Spotlight\nGery has 6 years of experience working in business development at FAANG and investing in startups in central & eastern Europe as a VC. He is a self-taught developer (CS50) who made his first steps in solidity development end of 2020 going through the likes of CryptoZombies, Ethernaut, DappUnivserity etc. Beginning of 2022 (at the time when he joined D_D 🙂 ) he started to work on Blocktorch together with his co-founder Amine who is a seasoned software engineer.\n🔥 About Blocktorch\nFrom the About page of Blocktorch:\nThe number of decentralized applications, their developers as well as users are growing at rapid speed, yet the tooling around web3 is not evolving fast enough. The underlying decentralized architecture is getting more complex and less understandable. To ensure web3 is mass market ready reliability is key.  The talented engineering teams pushing the frontiers of innovation need the best tools to build the best products.  \nWe at Blocktorch are re-imagining how developers build and maintain their decentralized applications. We believe in empowering every software engineering team to gain a deeper understanding of their smart contracts as well as other decentralized components such that they can troubleshoot and resolve anomalies in minutes, not hours.\nWebsite: blocktorch.xyz\nTwitter: twitter.com/blocktorch\nGery's Twitter: twitter.com/GeryPollak\nGery's Discord handle: CapG(blocktorch.xyz)#9916\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpQ3_Atfnw",
