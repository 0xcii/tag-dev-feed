At present there are a lot of challenges faced with building decentralized applications:\nFor users, the onboarding process is severely complex - requiring new user to install various wallet extensions and learn about private key management before they even interact with the dApp is a taxing effort.\nFor developers, it is no hidden secret that building Web 3 applications is also significantly complex. The average developer will not only have to have proficiency both at the protocol level for blockchain development, they must also possess application level proficiency to build a successful dApps to their users. This increases the time to market.\nFor individuals/teams with limited time and resources, this effort would be better spent improving their core product and iterating quickly for their users.\nTherefore, we built the Mirror World Smart SDK to make it easy for developers to:\nOnboard new Web3 users with one click. - No more seed-phrases! Mirror World's Smart Auth provides authentication with methods your users are already familiar with.\nFast-track your Web3 development time. - The Mirror World API provides a simple, yet powerful and declarative interface for interacting with the chain.\nTarget multiple platforms - The Mirror World Smart SDK is cross-platform. Build for the Web. Build for Mobile. Build with speed.\nUseful Resources:\nCongregated list of Resources (use this to get started with Mirror World)\nWebsite\nJonathon's Twitter\nüé• Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfFieWwtDhg",
