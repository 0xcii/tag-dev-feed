          "description": "Generating truly random numbers on a computer is a complex mathematical problem. However, most programming languages today have either native support for generating random numbers or come with supporting libraries that generate random numbers with an acceptable level of determinism mixed in.\nWhile generating acceptably-random numbers is a mostly solved problem in traditional computing, it is nigh impossible to do so on blockchains.\nYes, you could hash together a bunch of block and transaction data with a keccak256 function, but that is ad-hoc at best and is definitely not production-worthy code today.\nIf you've been in Web3 for any reasonable amount of time, you have undoubtedly heard of Chainlink.\nChainlink is a decentralized oracle network that feeds a variety of data to blockchains in r…",

          "description": "As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, so does the need for secure smart contracts. With billions of dollars locked in DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications, the stakes are high for developers to ensure that their code is free of vulnerabilities. Manual smart contract audits are the gold standard, but demand is high and good auditors are rare. The results are long waiting lists and prices that can quickly reach a six-digit range. An audit is usually performed when the project is mostly finished, and potential security debt has already piled up.\nOn top of that, the human eye is not perfect and might still miss critical bugs; you need more than audits short before launch to secure your locked funds appropriately. This is where security tools come into play.\nSecurity best practices ad…",
