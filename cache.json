          "description": "Frames excited enough users to make Farcaster worth their time. To be honest, I wouldnt say I liked Farcaster at first, as it required installing a native app on my phone. In 2024, when its called Web3; why would anyone install a native app?! \nAt least the Warpcast app works in the browser after completing the registration process, so why not try it? Especially with all the hype around Frames. And when Im already on it, why not write a few words about it?\nSo, here it is, yet another Farcaster Frames explainer for you!\nWhat are Farcaster Frames?\nTechnically, Frames are an extension of the Open Graph protocol (OGP) but a peculiar one, as you can use OGP features just as a fallback and not mix them.\nIn practice, you use the fc:frame or the og: metatags.

The time of crowdfunding is over!\nIn this article, you will learn the aim behind QF and the potential opportunities embedded in it.\nSit back and enjoy reading!\n\nHistory of Quadratic Funding\n\nUnsplash: Joanna\nWe must first trace its origins to understand QF (a.k.a plural funding).
