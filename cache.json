          "description": "🌈 GM\nIn this week's episode of DevNTell, we were joined by co-founders Luke and Kui who gave us an overview of Koinos Account Protocol (KAP).\n🌟 Developer Spotlight\nKui and Luke are co-founders of the Koinos Account Protocol but previously were on DevNTell showcasing their first project, BurnKoin. Kui is a structural engineer from New York but has a deep passion for web3 that drove him to found KAP with Luke. Luke is a software developer by trade, spending the last decade doing web development but has dived into web3 only in the last couple of years. Fun fact: Luke and Kui have founded two projects together but have never met in real life yet!\n🔥 About KAP\nFrom the KAP About Page:\nKAP makes it easy to access dApps without buying tokens. You just get a free or premium username and go. Built on the Koinos blockchain, KAP is the backbone of social, gaming, and any other free-to-use dApp. It will evolve to include a host of features that make it easy to experience blockchain for free.\nResources:\n KAP website\n KAP Whitepaper\n KAP Twitter\n🤝 Guests\nLuke: https://twitter.com/lukemwillis\nKui: https://twitter.com/kuixihe\n\n🎥 Presentation\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJAPbmlxp3c",
