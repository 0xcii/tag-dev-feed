If you're reading this, it didn't. \nIt All Began with the Pandemic\nI can trace this feeling back to COVID times, but I just noticed it recently. Well, a month or so ago. I saw hints of it after I was sick after returning from Cosmoverse in Medellin, Colombia. I was tired in a way I had never been before. I was tired of having fun. I was tired of talking to my friends, and I was tired of work. I was going through the motions of being alive but detached from reality.
