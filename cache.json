In this presentation, Gilad demos how to use 0xCord with Chainlink VRF V2 both on-chain and off-chain.\n🌟 Developer Spotlight\nGilad studied computer science at Columbia and has been writing solidity code for the past 5 years. Hes currently working on 0xCord, a web3 infra hub for developers.\n🔥 About 0xCord\n0xCord.com is a web3 infra hub for developers. It's the easiest way to access web3 infrastructure via native payments, composability, and configuration, all in one unified place. With 0xCord's off-chain API, you can easily consume the Chainlink VRF V2 through a simple RESTful JSON API call, bridging the gap between web2 and decentralized web3 infrastructure.
